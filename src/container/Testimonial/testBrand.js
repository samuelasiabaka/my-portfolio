I was so impressed, I returned for a complete re-branding project and he even took it upon himself to organise the printing of my stationery for me. The proof is in the pudding as they say!',

      'Samuel instantly helped me understand my hosting requirements and put a simple plan of action in place which met my needs as a startup user. He advised me on domain registration, gave my website a home, and took the time to discuss all of the issues I had due to my inexperience in the setting up a new host. With his services and guidance I can finally take my personal site to the next level.',

He was able to translate exactly what I wanted into my website, he kept me fully informed at every stage of the process, he was extremely efficient and he explained everything to me in plain-english and not "techie" language which I have often found in my dealings with other web designers in the past.',
